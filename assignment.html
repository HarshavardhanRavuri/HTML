<h1>I Tag</h1>
<p> <b>Used to for italian syting</b> </p>
<p>The HTML element represents a range of <i> text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations,</i> among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the  naming of this element. </p>
